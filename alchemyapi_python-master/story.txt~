The students of National Institute of Technology (NIT), Warangal have resorted to a flash protest during the late evening hours on Thursday over poor quality of food being served to them.

Hundreds of B Tech and M Tech students gathered at the NIT food court mess on the campus holding placards and raising slogans. They demanded the institute management to immediately change the contractor of the mess.

“We are being charged Rs 100 per day towards the meals but the food served is not even worth Rs 30. Hygiene is given a go in the mess and the food is not palatable at all,” complained a student, who does not want to be named. 

The protesting students alleged that the mess contractor is acting carelessly as he enjoys backing from the NIT Director. ‘It is sad that such things happen in a national institute like NIT Warangal. All the messes on the campus should be revived,’ students said.  

It was said that there are six institute-run messes on the campus, of which three are closed. In the place of closed ones, a private contractor opened a mess. The students are being forced to join in those messes, they said. 

“If all six messes run properly, there won’t be any problem for students”, the students said. They also wanted a probe into the allegations made by former chairman of Board of Directors Ella Krishna in a letter to the HRD Ministry. 

The students were denied basic amenities and lot of irregularities have been taking place on the campus, the students alleged.
